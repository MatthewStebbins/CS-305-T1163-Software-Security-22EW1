Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial provides individualized financial plans. We were brought on to provided a external website and backend that uses current secure coding practices to protect highly sensitive data.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I did well at generating checksums and displaying the Hex code to the frontend. Software security if not used can close a business like this one and expose important personal information the customer trusted you with.
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The most challenging part was the reilization of how many vulnerabilities there are when I ran the Maven static test.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I would follow the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to breakdown the different areas to know which area to focus on.
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  The only way to hope your code is funtional and secure is to have a secure coding mindset and after refactoring code running the same tests against it.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Maven, checksum, and a better understanding of ciphers.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  The most important experience is the hands on use of Maven to perform static testing.
